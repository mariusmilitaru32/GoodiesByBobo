<h1 align="center">GoodiesByBobo Website</h1>

[View the live project here](https://mariusmilitaru32.github.io/GoodiesByBobo/)

GoodiesByBobo is a business that primarly sells home made cookies and cakes.I created a website for my friend's business because I believe in her passion and the quality of her products. As someone who has sampled her delicious cookies firsthand, I know that they are truly exceptional and deserve to be shared with a wider audience. I also believe that a website can help my friend's business stand out in a competitive market. With so many options for consumers to choose from, having a well-designed and user-friendly website can make all the difference in attracting new customers and building brand loyalty.
